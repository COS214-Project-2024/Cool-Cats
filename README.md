# Team-6

Welcome to the Cool Cats City Builder, here we provide an interactive game to the users where they can manage and customize their own city
But first, lets start from the beginning

1. clone our github repository main branch: git clone https://github.com/COS214-Project-2024/Cool-Cats.git
2. Have all cpp and h files be in the same folder, else you have to change the include paths (trust me, its takes a while)
3. make and run the make file to start the game, this game will go on until the government runs out of budget, instructions and tutorials are included while you are running which explains the systems we have implemented and how it works
4. To end the game, go back to the first screen and just Exit  
3. (Optional) If you want to run our unit tests you have to first clone the google test repository, so
    3.1 git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
    3.2 Use our CmakeList.txt file
    3.3 Create or use our folder can build
    3.4 All of our existing tests will be in the Tests folder, please note, some of us had our own unit tests in our own branches, so if you want to run those tests you may have to pull them from their respective branches
    3.5 run the commands: 
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ctest
    Then you will see all our tests run (and hopefully pass)

5. Sit back and enjoy, We all hope you have fun testing and running our city builder, change and add code if you want to if you want to customize anything, just please dont push it :)
